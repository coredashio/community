# Subprojects

## Perses

The first subproject is [Perses](https://github.com/perses/perses). Perses is aiming to become a dashboard visualization tool for Prometheus and other datasources. It will focus on being GitOps-compatible via a new and well-defined dashboard definition model. 

## More subprojects coming soon

If you have a project (or want to start one) that would be a good fit for this
effort, please reach out on the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/g/coredash-discuss) to discuss contributing a
new subproject to this Linux Foundation effort.
