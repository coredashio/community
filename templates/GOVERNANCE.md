# [TODO: PROJECT NAME] Governance

## Maintainers

[TODO: PROJECTNAME] Maintainers have write access to the project GitHub repository.
They can merge their own patches or patches from others. Maintainers collectively manage the project's
resources and contributors. The current maintainers are:
[TODO: LIST OF MAINTAINERS OR LINK TO SOMETHING LIKE AN OWNERS FILE]. 

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the [TODO: PROJECTNAME] project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.
