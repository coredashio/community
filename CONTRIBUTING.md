# Contributing Guide

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project!

Because this is an umbrella project, you should consider contributing 
to one of our [subprojects](subprojects.md), which will have different
instructions for contributing depending on the project.

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. We encourage our
contributors to join our mailing list and attend meetings if possible. Details
about how to communicate with us can be found in our [README](README.md).

## Maintainers

The list of current maintainers can be found in
[.github/settings.yml](.github/settings.yml)

## Sign Your Commits

For contributions to this repo, we use a DCO process.

### DCO
Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running 

    git commit --amend -s
